# I don't have periods, can I set up a Tampon Club?

Yes! If either of the following are true:

- You use the women's toilets
- Your workplace has shared toilets or one shared toilet (sometimes the accessible toilet is shared)

Setting up a Tampon Club is a piece of cake, head over to the [Setting up a Tampon Club](setting-up) page and get cracking!

## Aren't people going to think I'm a little odd?

Possibly? Probably. But here's the deal: do it anonymously and let us take the fall. Set up a Tampon Club in your shared toilets, stock it with some tampons and some sanitary towels. It's going to cost you about Â£5 to get going. Leave an explanation about what it is, pointing people to [tampon.club](http://tampon.club). If anyone has any questions about it, they can ask us.

## Will I have to maintain it forever?

Nope! add a little note inviting anyone who finds it useful to contribute and hopefully it will become self-sustaining. If it doesn't, well, you tried. Head over to the [Setting up a Tampon Club](setting-up) page for more tips on how to get started.
