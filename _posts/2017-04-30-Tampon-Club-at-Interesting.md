#Â Tampon Club at Interesting

Hi! We haven't blogged in a long time but we're still here, and still sending out stickers.

Back in September, Tampon Club founder Alice Bartlett (literally me - I'm typing about myself in the 3rd person) gave a 7 minute talk about starting the origins of Tampon Club. The talk was at [Interesting](http://www.reasonablyinteresting.co.uk/index.php/london/interesting-2016/), an evening event with lots of speakers talking about interesting things.

The talk has at least one joke about periods, you can listen to it and see the slides over on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJbpTVDOkxM).

If you want someone from Tampon Club to come talk at your event (reminder, it's just going to be Alice) [get in touch!](mailto:hi@tampon.club)
