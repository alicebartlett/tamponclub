In offices that don't provide free tampons for staff, it's easy to get caught out when you need one. Tampon Club is just a bunch of women leaving tampons and sanitary towels in their workplace toilets, so that they're available when required. No more walking back to your locker to get out a tampon, no more sneaking one up your sleeve; tampons in the loo when you need one. Simple as that.

## Can I start my own Tampon Club?
Yes! Having a Tampon Club in your office is brilliant and extremely easy to do. Head over to [our page about setting one up](setting-up-a-tampon-club) to find out more. Once you're done, don't forget to let us know! Send us an email to [hi@tampon.club](mailto:hi@tampon.club) or catch us on Twitter at [@tampon_club](http://twitter.com/tampon_club). Send us a photo of your set-up and maybe we'll send you some Tampon Club stickers.

## Who is behind this?
A shadowy cabal of menstruating women, natch.
