#You can now buy Tampon Club starter kits at the #civicshop in Somerset House

In December [Cassie Robinson](http://twitter.com/CassieRobinson) got in touch with us to ask if we'd like to sell 'Tampon Club starter kits' as part of her [Civic Shop in Somerset House](http://www.civicworkshop.city/civic-shop/).

(from [http://www.civicworkshop.city/](http://www.civicworkshop.city/blog/2015/1/15/we-are-now-open))

>The Civic Shop showcases the work of a new generation of civic activists and social designers - inventors of new public spaces, new economies and champions of public good in everyday life.

>At the Civic Shop, there are some things that are for sale and some things that are free. Any money made goes back into the causes that inspired the products in the first place. Most of all though, each of the initiatives showcased here is an invitation to participate.
