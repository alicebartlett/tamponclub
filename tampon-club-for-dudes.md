# Tampon Club for dudes

Since we set up Tampon Club a bunch of stand up gents have asked us

> I'm a man! I'd like to help the people having periods in my office, what can I do?

Well, first thing's first, thank you for your enquiry. It's cool that you want to help. Now, it's kind of tricky to offer advice on this because the best course of action depends on a couple of things, like what your job is, what the toilets in your office are like, how many women you work with etcetera. We started writing the longest blog post in the world to explain this but then realised what we really needed was...

[Tampon Club for dudes -the QUIZ!](/quiz/)

## I'm a dude and I don't want to help

That's fine. The women around you are almost certainly handling their periods perfectly fine without your intervention. But, if you think Tampon Club is a good idea and that your office could benefit from one, then TAKE THE QUIZ because it took us ages to make and maybe you'll realise there is something very low effort you could do to improve the lives of your pals with periods.
