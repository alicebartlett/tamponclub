In offices that don't provide free tampons or pads for staff, it's easy to get caught out when you need one. Tampon Club is just a group of people leaving tampons and sanitary towels in their workplace toilets, so that they're available when required. No more walking back to your desk to get a tampon, no more sneaking one up your sleeve; tampons in the loo when you need one. Simple as that.
