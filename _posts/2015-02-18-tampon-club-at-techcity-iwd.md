#Tampon Club at TechCityIWD!

We're delighted to announce that Tampon Club is one of the exhibitors at the third annual [Tech City International Women's Day Showcase](http://techcityiwd.com/), an evening celebration of women's work in technology and the creative industries.

The event takes place on the 6th of March at the Digital Catapult Centre in Kings Cross. It will feature the work of many talented and smart women from the area. You can read about last year's event [here](http://jessicalaurence.com/2014/03/14/show-and-tell-how-women-are-making-themselves-more-visible-in-business/).


## Free starter kits!
As part of our attendance we'll be giving away 5 [Tampon Club starter kits](/2015/02/04/tampon-club-in-somerset-house.html#whats-in-a-tampon-club-starter-kit) for you to take back to your office. We'll be giving them on a first come first served basis, but if you miss out you can still buy them from [the Civic Shop at Somerset House](/2015/02/04/tampon-club-in-somerset-house.html).

Tickets for the showcase are Â£5, 100% of which goes to [Solace Women's Aid](http://www.solacewomensaid.org/).
