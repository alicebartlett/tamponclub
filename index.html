  <h1>Welcome to Tampon Club</h1>
  <p>In offices that don't provide free tampons for staff, it's easy to get caught out when you need one. Tampon Club is just a bunch of women leaving tampons in their workplace toilets, so that they're there when needed. No more walking back to your locker to get out a tampon, no more sneaking one up your sleeve. Simple as that.</p>
  
  <h2>Can I start my own Tampon Club?</h2>
  <p>Yes! Having a Tampon Club in your office is brilliant and extremely easy to do. Head over to <a href="setting-up-a-tampon-club">our page about setting one up</a> to find out more and, once you're done, drop us an email and we'll send you some Tampon Cub stickers.</p>
  
  <h2>Who is behind this?</h2>
  <p>A shadowy cabal of menstruating women, natch.</p>
