Hi! We haven't blogged in a long time but we're still here, and still sending out stickers.

Back in September, Tampon Club founder Alice Bartlett (literally me - I'm typing about myself in the 3rd person) gave a 7 minute talk about starting the origins of Tampon Club. The talk was at [Interesting](http://www.reasonablyinteresting.co.uk/index.php/london/interesting-2016/), an evening event with lots of speakers talking about interesting things.

The talk has at least one joke about periods in it, you can listen to the talk and see the slides over on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJbpTVDOkxM).
